# DRY(DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF)

A collection of snippets covering all of [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/), [socket.io](http://socket.io/), [passportjs](http://passportjs.com/), [electron](http://electron.atom.io/),  and [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) APIs.

## Notes

* In software engineering, Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures.

* Using #DRY shouldn't be a problem, since you don't have to type out the complete prefix before choosing a snippet. If there is a better way to avoid prefix conflicts, please let me know in my [github issue](https://github.com/dayogreats/dry/issues/new).


* Contributions are always appreciated. Please fork this repo, make changes or additions, and send a pull request.

Thanks!
