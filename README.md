# DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)

A collection of snippets covering all of the Expressjs, body-parser APIs.

## Notes

* In software engineering, Don't Depeat Yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures.
It shouldn't be a problem, since you don't have to type out the complete prefix before choosing a snippet. If there is a better way to avoid prefix conflicts, please let me know in a [github issue](https://github.com/dayogreats/dry/issues/new).
* Contributions are always appreciated. Please fork this repo, make changes or additions, and send a pull request.

Thanks!
