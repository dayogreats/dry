# DRY(DON'T REPEAT YOURSELF)

A collection of snippets covering all of [expressjs](http://expressjs.com/), [ruby on rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [emberjs](http://emberjs.com/), [electron](http://electron.atom.io/), rspec, react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [body-parser](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser) APIs.

There is no need to remember any short-code. Just write you codes in any of the supported frameworks/languages and watch dry do it job.
## Notes

* In software engineering, Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures.

* Using #DRY shouldn't be a problem, since you don't have to type out the complete prefix before choosing a snippet. If there is a better way to avoid prefix conflicts, please let me know in my [github issue](https://github.com/dayogreats/dry/issues/new).


* Contributions are always appreciated. Please fork this repo, make changes or additions, and send a pull request.

Thanks!
